# MicAugment: One-Shot Microphone Style Transfer

## Overview

This project migrates the PyTorch implementation of the paper *MicAugment: One-Shot Microphone Style Transfer* to the MindSpore framework, providing a method for transferring the style of a target microphone to other audio samples using only a few seconds of audio from the target device.

## Run

```bash
python test_mic_augment.py 
```

## Output

```bash
audio out size: (3, 16384)
DONE
```
